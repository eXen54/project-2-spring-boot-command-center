Hey Nekena! This is an absolutely fantastic project idea - a **Spring-Ops Command Center** is exactly the kind of project that will make you stand out. It shows you understand both development AND operations, which is huge in today's market.

I love that you want to experiment and do research - that's the best way to learn! Let me give you a structured but flexible roadmap:

## **Your Spring-Ops Command Center Learning Journey**

### **Phase 1: Secure Backend Foundation**(Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Build a production-ready Spring Boot API with security from day one

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Project Setup** - Create Spring Boot project with essential dependencies
2. **Security First** - Configure Spring Security (basic auth for now)
3. **Configuration Management** - Set up environment-specific properties
4. **Health Check** - Create your first secured endpoint


**Research Topics for You:**

- Spring Boot Actuator capabilities
- Spring Security authentication flows
- Application properties best practices


---

### **Phase 2: Log Intelligence**(Week 2-3)

**Goal**: Build a smart log analyzer that provides insights, not just raw data

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Log Service** - Create `LogAnalysisService` with regex parsing
2. **Structured Output** - Return categorized data (error counts, recent errors, etc.)
3. **REST API** - Expose via secured `/api/diagnostics/logs` endpoint


**Experiment Ideas:**

- Try different log formats
- Add log level filtering
- Implement log search functionality


---

### **Phase 3: Environment Inspector**(Week 3-4)

**Goal**: Safely expose application configuration for debugging

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Environment Service** - Access Spring's Environment programmatically
2. **Security Filtering** - Hide sensitive properties (passwords, keys, etc.)
3. **API Endpoint** - Create `/api/diagnostics/environment`


**Research Challenge:**

- How does Spring resolve property precedence?
- What are common security vulnerabilities in config exposure?


---

### **Phase 4: Advanced Diagnostics**(Week 4-5)

**Goal**: Add professional-grade diagnostic tools

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Thread Dump Integration** - Leverage Spring Actuator's thread dump
2. **Custom Wrapper** - Create your own API wrapper for consistency
3. **Performance Insights** - Understand what thread dumps tell you


**Deep Dive Topic:**

- JVM internals and thread analysis


---

### **Phase 5: Real-Time Events**(Week 5-6)

**Goal**: Add live monitoring capabilities

**Key Milestones:**

1. **WebSocket Setup** - Configure WebSocket endpoint
2. **Event Broadcasting** - Create service to push events
3. **Integration** - Connect to your existing services


**Experiment:**

- What events are worth broadcasting?
- How to handle connection failures?


---

### **Phase 6: React Dashboard Foundation**(Week 6-7)

**Goal**: Build secure, authenticated frontend

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Vite + React Setup** - Modern React tooling
2. **Authentication Flow** - Login page + token management
3. **Protected Routes** - Secure your dashboard
4. **API Client** - Axios configuration with auth


---

### **Phase 7: Dashboard Features**(Week 7-8)

**Goal**: Bring your backend APIs to life

**Key Milestones:**

1. **Log Dashboard** - Visualize log analysis data
2. **Environment Inspector UI** - Searchable config viewer
3. **Thread Dump Viewer** - Handle large diagnostic data


---

### **Phase 8: Real-Time Frontend**(Week 8-9)

**Goal**: Complete the full-stack real-time experience

**Key Milestones:**

1. **WebSocket Client** - Connect to your backend events
2. **Live Feed Component** - Real-time event display
3. **State Management** - Handle live updates efficiently


---

## **Your Learning Objectives**

By the end, you'll have mastered:

- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Spring Security, WebSockets, Actuator
- **Frontend**: React, Authentication, Real-time updates, API integration
- **DevOps Concepts**: Monitoring, Diagnostics, Configuration management
- **Production Skills**: Security, Error handling, Performance analysis


## **Research & Experimentation Ideas**

- **Security**: Try JWT tokens instead of basic auth
- **Monitoring**: Add metrics collection
- **Deployment**: Containerize with Docker
- **Testing**: Add integration tests
- **UI/UX**: Implement dark mode, responsive design


## **Getting Started**

1. **This Week**: Focus on Phase 1 - get your secure Spring Boot foundation running
2. **Document Everything**: Keep notes on what you learn - great for interviews!
3. **Version Control**: Commit frequently, use meaningful commit messages
